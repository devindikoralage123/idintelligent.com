    <h1>WHAT IS AI ?</h1>
    <P>Artificial Intelligent is an interdisciplinary field focused on developing machines capable of
         performing complex tasks historically only humans could do, such as identifying trends and patterns,
          translating texts, and driving cars. Today, much of the AI we interact with is generally some type of machine learning, 
          which uses algorithms trained on data sets to create models capable of performing certain decision-oriented tasks.</P>

    <h1>WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE ?</h1>
    <P>Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business. 
        It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, 
        statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data.</P>

            <div class="course2-col">
                <h3>Business analyst</h3>
                <p>If you have an aptitude for communication in addition to mathematics and computer science, you might excel as a business analyst.
                     These can be key players in large corporations, helping business leaders 
                     and stakeholders understand the complex data their companies are receiving. This is a tremendously impactful role, 
                     as businesses take data more seriously than ever and are seeking the top advisors to help unpack the findings of the new tools at their disposal.
                      Business analysts are often top-ranking employees with significant expertise.</p>

                <h3>Data mining</h3>
                <p>Data mining is the process of sifting through large amounts of data to find patterns or anomalies that can help businesses understand their operations.
                     This can be used to identify problem points and draw attention to unexpected data outcomes, guiding solutions and even making predictions about how a business’
                     plans will go in the future. Data mining experts are highly valuable in arenas as disparate as marketing and interface models.</p>

                <h3>Data engineer</h3>
                <p>Data engineers play key roles in large organizations, acting as managers of the databases where all incoming data is stored.
                     Because this information is so valuable and so plentiful, businesses are relying greatly upon their data engineers to store and protect everything safely. It’s important that data engineers take an interest in evolutions in data storage systems,
                     as part of their work is ensuring that their database mechanisms are up to date in a rapidly transforming digital environment</p>
