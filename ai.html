                <h2>What is AI?</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is technology that enables computers and machines to simulate human intelligence and
                     problem-solving capabilities.On its own or combined with other technologies (e.g., sensors, geolocation, robotics) AI can perform tasks
                      that would otherwise require human intelligence or intervention. Digital assistants, GPS guidance, autonomous vehicles, 
                    and generative AI tools (like Open AI's Chat GPT) are just a few examples of AI in the daily news and our daily lives.</p>

                <h2>Artificial intelligence defined</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence is a field of science concerned with building computers and 
                    machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require 
                    human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze. 

                    AI is a broad field that encompasses many different disciplines, including computer
                     science, data analytics and statistics, hardware and software engineering, linguistics,
                      neuroscience, and even philosophy and psychology. 
                    
                    On an operational level for business use, AI is a set of technologies that are
                     based primarily on machine learning and deep learning, used for data analytics, 
                     predictions and forecasting, object categorization, natural language processing, 
                     recommendations, intelligent data retrieval, and more.</p>

                <h2>How does AI work?</h2>
                <p>While the specifics vary across different AI techniques, the core principle revolves around data.
                    AI systems learn and improve through exposure to vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and 
                    relationships that humans may miss.

                    This learning process often involves algorithms, which are sets of rules or instructions 
                    that guide the AI's analysis and decision-making. In machine learning, a popular subset of AI, 
                    algorithms are trained on labeled or unlabeled data to make predictions or categorize information. </p>

                <h2>Types of artificial intelligence</h2>
                <p>Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed. 

                    For instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.
                    <ol>
                     <li><u>Reactive machines:</u> Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules.
                     Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue that beat chess champion 
                     Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.</li>
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     <li><u>Limited memory:</u> Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to 
                    improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network
                     or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.</li>
                     <br><br>
                     <li><u>Theory of mind:</u> Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into
                     its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal
                      to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would.</li> 
                      <br><br>
                    <li> <u>self aware:</u> A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own 
                    existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory
                     of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist.</li>
                     </ol>
                      </p>
            </section>

                <h2>Artificial intelligence training models</h2>
                <p>When businesses talk about AI, they often talk about “training data.” But what does that mean? Remember that 
                    limited-memory artificial intelligence is AI that improves over time by being trained with new data.
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Supervised learning</b> is a machine learning model that maps a
                             specific input to an output using labeled training data (structured data). In simple terms,
                              to train the algorithm to recognize 
                            pictures of cats, feed it pictures labeled as cats.</li>

                            <li><b>Unsupervised learning</b> is a machine learning model that learns patterns based on unlabeled data (unstructured data). Unlike supervised
                                 learning, the end result is not known ahead of time. Rather, the algorithm learns from the data, categorizing it
                                 into groups based on attributes. For instance, unsupervised learning is good at pattern matching and descriptive modeling. 

                                In addition to supervised and unsupervised learning, a mixed approach called semi-supervised
                                 learning is often employed, where only some of the data is labeled. In semi-supervised learning, an end result is known, but the algorithm must figure 
                                 out how to organize and structure the data to achieve the desired results.</li>

                                 <li><b>Reinforcement learning</b> is a machine learning model that can be broadly described as “learn by doing.” An “agent” learns
                                     to perform a defined task by trial and error (a feedback loop) until its performance is within a desirable range. 
                                     The agent receives positive reinforcement when it performs the task well and negative reinforcement when it performs poorly. An example 
                                     of reinforcement learning would be teaching a robotic hand to pick up a ball.</li>

                <h2>Benefits of AI</h2>
                <p><ol><li><u>Automation</u> <br> <br> AI can automate workflows and processes or work independently and autonomously from a human team. For example, AI can help automate 
                    aspects of cybersecurity by continuously monitoring and analyzing network traffic. Similarly, a smart factory may have dozens of different kinds of AI in use,
                     such as robots using computer vision to navigate the factory floor or to inspect products for defects, create digital twins, or use real-time analytics to measure
                      efficiency and output.</li>
                    
                    <li><u>Reduce human error</u> <br> <br> AI can eliminate manual errors in data processing, analytics, assembly in manufacturing, and other tasks through automation
                         and algorithms that follow the same processes every single time.</li>
                        
                        
                        <li><u>Eliminate repetitive tasks</u> <br><br> AI can be used to perform repetitive tasks, freeing human capital to work on higher impact problems. 
                            AI can be used to automate processes, like verifying documents, transcribing phone calls, or answering simple customer questions like “what time do you close?” Robots are often used
                             to perform “dull, dirty, or dangerous” tasks in the place of a human. </li></ol></p>
